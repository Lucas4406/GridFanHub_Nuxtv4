The **2025 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix** delivered a dramatic finale under the Yas Marina lights. Strategic gambles, late-race pace swings, and intense midfield battles defined the season’s closing chapter. 

The three key competitors – Max, Norris, and Piastri all battled it out to the chequered flag – but Max Verstappen came on top. Unfortunately, he was just shy of Lando in the Drivers’ Championship crowning Lando Norris the **F1 Champion of the world** in 2025. 

There were also very close battles in the midfield – most notably Lewis Hamilton coming through from P16 to finish P8. May the celebration begin for the Champion!
